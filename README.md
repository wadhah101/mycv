# My CV

A cv doesn't need to be fancy, it just needs to be readable, design tools are not meant for that, cv websites are paywalled and overleaf is bloated and slow.

This repository contains a cv in LaTeX, a pdf and a website.

Check the pdf file at [main.pdf](main.pdf)

Check the website at [https://wadhah101.github.io/mycv/](https://wadhah101.github.io/mycv/)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `render.sh` to render the PDF and the HTML
3. Run `render-watch.sh` to watch for changes and render the PDF automatically

This rpeository uses github actions to render the pdf and deploy the website.

## Why bother?

Latex is a powerful tool, but it is also a pain to install. It contains several dependencies and bloats your system. Overleaf is a great tool but it is not free and it requires a subscription.

Using a docker container is the obvious solution.
